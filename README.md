In this project, I worked with a partner to find and clean data. We used data which included the text from tweets and their assigned sentiment values to 
see if a model could be created to accurately predict the sentiment of text. 

We trained, tested, and split the data and then used a variety of models in a gridsearch, without any significant results. We also explored transfer
learning neural networks, but they failed to be useful as well.
