In this project, I worked with a partner to find and clean data. We used data which included the text from tweets and their assigned sentiment values to
see if a model could be created to accurately predict the sentiment of text. 

We used a variety of models in a pipeline, as well as a transfer learning neural network, but ended up without any significant results.
